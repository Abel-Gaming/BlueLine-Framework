# What is BlueLine Framework?
BlueLine Framework was created by Abel Gaming for FiveM menu-based communities. This framework easily implements police functions into your community. Some functions of the framework include the following:
- Ticket System - Allow police in your server to ticket civilians. Tickets are placed into the database.
- Vehicle Impound System - Allow police to impound player's vehicles for different reasons. Police can also release the vehicle back to the owner from Mission Row PD.
- Law Enforcement Auto Vehicle Lock - Allow police officers to setup an auto-lock system for their vehicle. Officers can set at what distance they would like their vehicle to auto lock. After reaching that distance, their patrol vehicle will become locked. Officers must manually unlock their vehicle (hotkey to unlock can be changed in key bind settings).
- Law Enforcement Trunk Menu - Allows officers to get tools and weapons out of the trunk of their vehicle.

- Realistic Weapon System (Law Enforcement Only) - Require officers to pull shotguns and rifles out of their trunk to be able to use them.
